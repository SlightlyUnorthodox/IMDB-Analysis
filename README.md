Group Project for Fall section of UF CIS4930 Data Mining

# Notes

(Dax) I went ahead and drew up the core files that will be needed in this project. Whoever ends up being in the group, I hope everyone involved at least attempts all of the problems described in the project requirements. Also note the report is a .md which will be compiled to article format when the project is completed.
