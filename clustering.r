# Description: Procedure for finding similar movies (clustering)

#Dynamically load/install required packages
ready <- FALSE
loadPackages2 <- function() {
  if( require(R.utils) == FALSE) { install.packages("R.utils") }
  ready <- TRUE
}
while(ready == FALSE) { ready <- loadPackages2() }

# Load dataset/subset dataset
#
#
#
#


# Go forth and find similar movies
#
#
#
#
#
#






# Questions

# Which clustering method works best in this case? And why.

# Would clustering the movies into k' clusters where k' > k help in better categorization? And how.
